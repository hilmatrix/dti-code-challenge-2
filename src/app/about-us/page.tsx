                 <p className="text-justify">
                 Founded in 2024, Numinus Artspace began as a passion project between four creative individuals united by their 
                 love for gaming and digital art. From its humble beginnings in Indonesia, the team has worked together to create 
                 immersive games that blend artistic expression with cutting-edge technology. Numinus Artspace was born out of a 
                 shared vision to create unique, memorable game experiences that push the boundaries of creativity and storytelling 
                 in the gaming industry.

                 Since its inception, Numinus Artspace has grown from concept to reality. Within its first year, 
                 the team has successfully completed multiple game prototypes and collaborated on various creative projects,
                  showcasing their skills in both 2D and 3D art, animation, and game development. The studioâ€™s debut project, 
                  currently in development, aims to captivate players with innovative gameplay and a rich visual experience.
