               Founded in 2024, Numinus Artspace began as a passion project between four creative individuals united by their 
               love for gaming and digital art. From its humble beginnings in Indonesia, the team has worked together to create 
               immersive games that blend artistic expression with cutting-edge technology. Numinus Artspace was born out of a 
               shared vision to create unique, memorable game experiences that push the boundaries of creativity and storytelling 
               in the gaming industry.

                 showcasing their skills in both 2D and 3D art, animation, and game development. The studioâ€™s debut project,
